# To-Do-List
A to-do app is a software application that lets you make a list of tasks that you need to complete.
You can make daily or weekly lists of tasks in a to-do app. Once you complete a task, you can delete it  and update your to-do list. It is a convenient app that lets you keep track of your chores. 
To build a to-do app, you need not be a proficient Django developer â€“ you only need to have good knowledge of Django basics. You can create a simple to-do app using tools like JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, and then host your app on the localhost server by using Django/Flask framework.
